INTERNSHIP REPORT





During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on several impactful projects that enhanced my skills and contributed to the organizationâ€™s goals.
My primary tasks included developing a Carbon Footprint Calculator, which enables users to assess the environmental impact of their journeys and encourages them to opt for more sustainable travel alternatives.
This feature not only promotes eco-friendly choices but also offers incentives for users who select greener options. 
Additionally, I implemented Multi-Language Support to ensure our application is accessible to a diverse user base. 
This involved integrating internationalization (i18n) features, allowing users to select their preferred language while ensuring that all user interface text, labels, and messages were accurately translated. 
Another significant task was the development of a Rating and Review system for bus routes, enabling users to provide feedback after their journeys. 
This feature displays average ratings and reviews on the route details page, fostering a community of informed travelers. 
These projects were developed using the MEAN Stack, which provided a robust framework for building dynamic web applications. 
Overall, my internship experience was enriching, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings while contributing to meaningful projects that align with sustainability and user engagement goals.
